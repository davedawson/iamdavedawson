                <h4>Cover Letter</h4>
                <p class="large">Our climate crisis is an opportunity to do something  impactful and important. Let‚Äôs do it together.</p>
                <p>Stripe is a company with a long-term vision of a better way to do things, and a plan to do them with a commitment to quality. Your track record speaks for itself. And if Stripe is applying that approach to the climate crisis, I want to be a part of it. </p>
                <h3>A focus on progressive causes</h3>
                <p>I've been designing and building digital products for progressive causes for the past 12 years. In 2012, I left my job at Blue State Digital to start up a design studio and climate change has been of my main areas of focus.</p>
                <p>I put my studio on pause in 2019 to join the Tom Steyer presidential campaign where climate was our number one priority. As the creative director there, I led a department of 35 creatives made up of design, video, and content teams, to create everything visual that came out of that campaign. </p>
                <h3>Staying scrappy with small teams</h3>
                <p>Presidential campaigns aside, most of my experience has been with small teams where I'm the first/only product designer. So the use of the word "scrappy" in the job description jumped out to me as an appropriate label for my work style. </p>
                <p>I'm a designer who codes and my design process involves creating prototypes, testing and validating ideas with users, and refining ideas to an eventual pixel perfect product. But I understand that perfect shouldn't stand in the way of getting a product into user's hands. Working on small teams, I've often served in a pseudo-product manger role, and I'm used to prioritizing features and ice-boxing ideas for later.</p>
                <h3>Room to grow</h3>
                <p>One area where I'm lacking experience is working as part of a large-scale product design team. And I have to admit, I'm a little intimidated by you all! I have lots of room to grow, and I hope to soak up your experience. And I bring a unique perspective as someone who has worked in a number of different capacities and at different levels of organizations. As the principal of a design studio, I have a lot of experience wearing different hats and working directly with stakeholders at varying levels.</p>
                <h3>Excited to be talking with you</h3>
                <p>I've kept an eye on the work coming out of Stripe for years now, and I was especially impressed with Stripe's commitment to negative emissions. Way to lead by example! I'm excited to be applying for this job with Stripe's Climate team, and I appreciate the time you've taken to consider my work.</p>
                <p>Hope to hear from you soon!</p>
                <p>‚Äî Dave</p>

                            <h3>Overview</h3>
                            <p>CreativeMornings is a community of over 400,000 people all over the world that get together for monthly, in-person events. The organization had done what most would consider the "hard part" of creating an active community of people who show up in real life. But they hadn't invested in the digital experience. With such an active and passionate community, CreativeMornings had only scratched the surface of how to engage them online.</p>
                            <p>Tina Roth Eisenberg, the founder, brought me in to design all aspects of the CreativeMornings digital platform, which eventually evolved into a product called CreativeGuild. I designed the experience and interface of the product, along with all of the marketing materials.</p>
                            <p class="small"><em><strong>Note:</strong> This was a large project and I designed almost every aspect of it. So in order to dive into my design process in a bit more detail, I've focused on one feature in this case study.</em></p>

                    <h3>Starting with research</h3>
                    <p>As a team of creatives working on a product for creatives, we each had ideas for things we'd like to see included in what we called a "LinkedIn for creatives," but we wanted to make sure we were solving our audience's problems, and not our own. So we conducted interviews with a dozen creative professionals from the community to get a better understanding of how they would use a network like this to promote themselves and their work. </p>
                    <p>Based on those conversations, we created a few personas to guide us in making design decisions.</p>

                <div class="text-block">
                    <h3>Establishing a structure for storytelling</h3>
                    <p>From those interviews, I started to sketch out a structure for profiles pages in a way that allows the users to tell the story of their work. The user story for company pages was mainly for recruitment as an opportunity to highlight culture, some past work, and of course job openings. </p>
                    <p>For individuals, we created a profile that worked for all types of creatives, not just people who create visual deliverables. Our profiles needed to cover people who work in ideas, words, video, and static images. So I created a profile template that could be adapted to fit the person's type of work. This allowed them to display their work as a graphic, an embedded video, a headline, or a long piece of text.</p>
                    <p>And once we were ready to explore visual solutions, we were lucky to have a massive group of talented creatives to apply this structure to. I sampled from creative individuals all over the world to bring in different types of work, projects, and career timelines to stress-test our designs. We tested our sketches and designs with members of the global community and iterated the designs based on their feedback.</p>

                <div class="text-block">
                    <h3>Relying on, and expanding a visual system</h3>
                    <p>CreativeMornings has an established identity and design system and it's used by the community all over the world. It's not going anywhere. But their digital visual language hadn't been updated in years, so I took this as an opportunity to expand on the existing styles to make site look fresh, easy to browse, and modern.</p>

                <div class="text-block">
                    <h3>Opening the floodgates</h3>
                    <p>Once we'd established how companies and people would present themselves on the CreativeGuild, it was time to invite them to join. Our first users were companies who were already supporters of CreativeMornings in some capacity. They received a personalized email with an invite link and a code for a free year on the site. </p>
                    <p>I designed the onboarding flow with a few key considerations in mind:</p>
                    <ul class="inline">
                        <li><p class="lead"><strong>Quality of profiles</strong></p>
                            <p class="small">A social network is only as good as the quality of the profiles on it. Especially for a design-oriented organization like CreativeMornings. So yes, we need to make sure that companies can sign up quickly, but we also need to ensure that the profiles they create set a high standard that future companies will want to follow. </p>
                            <p class="small">I designed an invite and approval flow to start seeding companies into the product, while giving the CreativeMornings community team the ability to approve every application that was submitted before publishing. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li><p class="lead"><strong>Leaning into existing networks</strong></p>
                            <p class="small">How can we make our community members advocates for the product? We decided to make personal profiles free to the community, but to charge for company pages. So those users had a payment hurdle to get over.</p> 
                            <p class="small">As part of onboarding, I designed a flow for individuals to tag their employer as part of their profile, and to invite them to join the CreativeGuild and support the creative community. And in the company onboarding, companies are encouraged to tag their employees as part of the company to display them on their company page. </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                        <h4>Application flow</h4>
                        <p>Creating a profile that shows off your work and your company culture is a high-bar ask. So our onboarding flow was designed to make the process as smooth as possible, while ensuring that profiles met the high-standard of the CreativeGuild. I designed an experience that gave the user an opportunity to preview their company card and profile before submitting it for review.</p>

                            <p>Sierra Club‚Äôs AddUp platform is a tool to democratize the advocacy work the organization has been doing for the past 128 years. The tool puts the megaphone of the Sierra Club in the hands of community organizers and advocates to create change in their cities and regions. Organizers can use AddUp to create digital campaigns for causes all over the world. </p>
                            <p>I was brought on as a freelance product designer to design the back-end experience of AddUp. I collaborated with a UX researcher and an engineering lead on the project.</p>

                    <p>While Sierra Club has a well-established visual identity, AddUp was a relatively new product without much going for it. I was handed a logo and a couple of typeface suggestions. So one of the first things I did on the project was to establish some standards across the product to ensure consistency in the experience. The aim was to keep the authenticity of the existing Sierra Club brand, but bring in more of a grassroots energy. </p>

                    <p>Grassroots organizing doesn't have a simple, straight line to success. Some campaigns may focus on fundraising, while others are more about getting attention on social, and most require a combination of a number of tools. And supporters have varying comfort levels with taking action. </p>
                    <p>It's important to provide a spectrum of ways for people to get involved. And AddUp meets supporters where they are, and provides them with a way to take action however they're comfortable. </p>
                    <p>I designed a flow for campaign creators to add actions to their campaign and to prioritize certain actions as needed.</p>

                    <h3>Supporting our organizers</h3>
                    <p>Grassroots organizing is hard work. And so is managing a team of grassroots organizers. We had two types of users on the AddUp platform: </p>
                    <ul class="inline">
                        <li>Public facing users, the organizers</li>
                        <li>And the back-end users, the AddUp Digital team</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Every design decision made impacted both of these audiences. AddUp is a hands-on platform, compared to something like MoveOn. The AddUp Digital team is made up of experienced digital activists. And that team is actively involved with each campaign that gets created and supports the organizers throughout the campaign. </p>
                    <p>While the primary user of the product is a grassroots organizer, and that's who I was designing the interface for, I also had a mandate to reduce the amount of time that each Digital team member spends hand-holding an organizer when creating and running a campaign. The earlier the AddUp product can prompt an organizer with helpful information, the more likely they are to complete the process without needing help from the Digital team.</p>

                    <p>In an effort to get ahead of those types of issues with campaigns, I designed a system of contextual hints  that guide the organizer through the process and best practices of creating a campaign. </p>
                    <p>We allow the organizer to preview their campaign before submitting. In our user interviews, we received feedback that organizers wanted to see what their campaign is going to look like before publishing it. </p>
                    <p>In addition to helpers, the product does a check on the campaign before submitting for review.  If there are areas for improvement we ask the organizer to be more thorough before submitting. </p>

                    <p>Sierra Club supports every campaign published through AddUp, and as you'd expect, they have high expectations of their organizers. Every campaign gets reviewed by a member of the AddUp Digital team. I designed a feedback system that gives the reviewer the ability to make suggestions at a campaign-level, but also to dig into the weeds and provide notes on each section of a campaign. </p>
                    <p>Once feedback has been provided, the organizer is alerted in email about the notes. I designed a system where the organizer can view their notes alongside the campaign, and respond to a piece of feedback if needed.</p>

                    <h3>A scrappy campaign idea becomes a product</h3>
                    <p>The idea for this product came out of the Steyer campaign. During the campaign, we wanted to expand how we organized our supporters beyond SMS and email, so we started to use reactions to our social media posts as a lead-gen source. We then used those reactions to match supporters to the voter file, where we could verify their info and follow up with them. And it worked! The Facebook reactions became a valuable and reliable source of new supporters during the campaign.</p>
                    <p>This work originally happened with dozens of people working together a in a massive Google Sheet. And it was great as a proof of concept. With Fired Up, we've taken that concept and applied it to a Chrome extension to make the matching more intuitive and results easy to track. </p>

                    <h3>Validating the value</h3>
                    <p>After the campaign ended, a small group of us got together to brainstorm on how to turn this idea into a product. We all knew that it was valuable for us during the primary, but would it work other types of campaigns?</p>
                    <p>We talked with other Steyer staffers in different roles and with different perspectives on the data that came from matching. And we spoke with other campaigns that may benefit from something like this to gauge interest in the idea.</p>
                    <p>At this phase of the project, my role was mainly  designing priority screens to illustrate the concept and the value of the product, and to meet with potential users and demo our ideas for them.</p>

                    <p>My role in this process was to create user flows and wireframes for the product, and to help the team think through feature priorities. The wireframes created during this process were especially helpful for the product team to visualize what would be required to build each feature and help narrow scope. </p>
                    <p>Based on those flows and wireframes, the engineering team worked quickly to get a limited, but working version of the extension off to a campaign to begin testing it.</p>

                    <p>Once we had real campaign staffers using the MVP and finding it valuable, it was clear that it was time to start designing the full product. </p>
                    <p>Our product sits on top of a website that is already incredibly cluttered, and our users are looking to do their jobs as quickly as possible. So whitespace, clarity and affordance were my top-priorities during the design process. I wanted to make sure that organizers would be able to scan a supporter's Facebook page and find the Match button in our extension as quickly as possible </p>
                    <p>What we heard from campaigns is that yes, this tool is great to find new supporters, but can Fired Up also support outreach? Can we contact our supporters on the platform they expressed their support for us? </p>
                    <p><strong>You betcha.</strong> I designed an outreach section of the extension that prompts organizers to call, text, or message their supporters immediately after matching.</p>

                    <h3>Dynamic asks</h3>
                    <p>One of the most important features is the ability to tailor the ask to the supporter's voter registration status. If a supporter isn't registered to vote, then obviously, the most important thing we can ask them to do is to register. If a supporter is registered, then we may have a few different asks for them. Fired Up allows admins to choose those asks and set a priority on asks and on outreach channels.</p>

                    <p>Messaging in political campaigns goes through lots and lots of revisions and approvals before it gets into the hands of an organizer or a volunteer. And it's important for a campaign to be able to write a script for any outreach that happens. </p>
                    <p>I designed a branching conversational flow system that displays the action scripts in a way that's for the organizer, and allows for conditional follow-up asks dependent on the last recorded answer. There's one thing I know for sure, outreach scripts will surely change. And this pattern allows campaigns to change their scripts on the fly without interrupting the rest of the outreach flow.</p>

                    <p>Fired Up is still a young product, but we've already gotten great feedback and numbers from the campaigns that are using it. I'm excited to see what sort of impact this tool can have this fall as campaigns swing into high gear.</p>
