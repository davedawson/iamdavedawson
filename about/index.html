            <p class="large">Hello! I'm Dave and I live in California with my wife, Mary, and our dog, Spock.</p>
            <p class="large">Letâ€™s be friends?</p>
            <p>Itâ€™s a standard practice to present myself with some sort of professional label here. But, I struggle with that. Labels are contextual and constantly changing. So I created this ice-breaker card for you to explore a few of those:</p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>I'm happiest when I'm meeting new people and doing work that helps others. Iâ€™ve been given so much through the kindness of other, and I try to do my best to pay it forward. </p>
            <p>My approach is to work hard, be genuine, kind, and enthusiastic, and help others. When I do those, things seem to work themselves out in the end. When Iâ€™m going with the grain, things seem to work out better than if Iâ€™d planned them myself.</p>

            <h3>How I got here</h3>
            <p>Before starting Cottleston Pie, I was the principal designer at <a href="http://bluestate.co/">Blue State</a> in Manhattan. And in 2019 I took a sabbatical from my design studio to serve as the creative director on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/08/opinion/tom-steyer-president.html"></a>Tom Steyer presidential campaign</a>. While the campaign didn't end the way we'd hoped, I'm incredibly proud of my team, the work we made, and of course Tom. </p>
            <p>I&#39;ve been privileged to work in the progressive space for most of my career, and have been able to create work for dozens of wonderful organizations. A few career highlights are <a href="http://pih.org">Partners in Health</a>, <a href="http://hrc.org">Human Rights Campaign</a>, <a href="http://harpers.org">Harper&#39;s Magazine</a>, <a href="http://surfrider.org">Surfrider</a>, and <a href="http://filmlinc.org">Film at Lincoln Center</a>.</p>
            <p>We're actively looking for new projects, so please [reach out](http://www.havesomecottlestonpie.com/hire/).</p>

        <h3>Never not moving</h3>
        <p>I made a promise to myself to never become complacent with work or life. And that has been one of my most important guiding principles. Every day, I try appreciate what's in front of me, and to push myself to always be learning something new.</p>
        <p>What I loved about being in college was the opportunity to constantly experiment and to learn. And I've tried to keep that perspective in my daily life. </p>
        <p>Iâ€™ve put together a page of all of the personal projects Iâ€™ve created from this dedication. I call them adventures.</p>
        <p>Right now, I'm actively learning: </p>
        <ul class="inline">
            <li>How to write short stories</li>
            <li>Meditation (beginners mind!)</li>
            <li>Surfing</li>
            <li>How to improve my photography</li>
            <li>Arduino</li>
            <li>How to become a good neighbor in a new town during quarantine</li>

            <h3>A road trip to remember</h3>
            <p>Both Mary and I work remotely, and we realized that we no longer needed to live in NYC for our jobs. And we were ready for something different. But we werenâ€™t sure where we wanted to move. </p>
            <p>So in the spring of 2017, we put all of our stuff in storage and drove out of New York to explore the U.S. Originally planned as a six-month road trip, we ended up traveling for two years, with over 60 stops. Some of the highlights are on Instagram with the #dawsonsontherun hashtag. And the timeline is below.</p>
