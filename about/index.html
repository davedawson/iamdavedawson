        <h2>About me</h2>
        <h3>Hi! I'm Dave and I live in California with my wife, Mary, and our dog, Spock.</h3>
        <p>This is where I'm supposed to give myself some sort of professional label. But this is exactly where I struggle to do so. Those labels are contextual and constantly changing. I've been called a husband, a studio owner, a creative director, a cyclist, a designer, an artist, a road-tripper, a front-end developer, and a whole lot more.</p>
        <p>The through line of most of those is that I'm happiest when I'm meeting new people and helping others.</p>

        <h3>Work</h3>
        <p>In 2012, I started a tiny digital studio called [**Cottleston Pie**.](http://www.havesomecottlestonpie.com/) We create websites and products for progressive causes, organizations, and companies. Over the past 8 years we've been incredibly fortunate to work with some truly inspiring people and causes. I'm grateful that I get to do the work that I do. </p>
        <p>Before starting Cottleston Pie, I was the principal designer at [Blue State](http://bluestate.co/) in Manhattan. And in 2019 I took a sabbatical from my design studio to serve as the creative director on the [Tom Steyer presidential campaign](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/08/opinion/tom-steyer-president.html). While the campaign didn't end the way we'd hoped, I'm incredibly proud of my team, the work we made, and of course Tom. </p>
        <p>I've been privileged to work in the progressive space for most of my career, and have been able to create work for dozens of wonderful organizations. A few career highlights are [Partners in Health](http://pih.org), [Human Rights Campaign](http://hrc.org), [Harper's Magazine](http://harpers.org), [Surfrider](http://surfrider.org), and [Film at Lincoln Center](http://filmlinc.org). </p>
        <p>We're actively looking for new projects, so please [reach out](http://www.havesomecottlestonpie.com/hire/).</p>

        <h3>Personal</h3>
        <p>I made a promise to myself to never become complacent with work or life. And that has been one of my most important guiding principles. Every day, I try appreciate what's in front of me, and to push myself to always be learning something new.</p>
        <p>In 2017 my wife, our dog, Spock, and I put all of our stuff in storage and drove out of New York to explore the U.S. Originally scheduled as a six-month road trip, we ended up traveling for two-years. Some of the highlights are on Instagram with the #dawsonsontherun hashtag. </p>
        <p>We recently settled into Encinitas, CA, where we're planning to stay put for a while.</p>

        <p><strong>Always experimenting</strong></p>
        <p>What I loved about being in college was the opportunity to constantly experiment and to learn. And I've tried to keep that perspective in my daily life.</p>
        <p>Right now, I'm actively learning:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How to write short stories</li>
            <li>Surfing</li>
            <li>Meditation <em>(Always. Beginner's mind!)</em></li>
            <li>How to improve my photography</li>
            <li>Arduino</li>
            <li>How to become a good neighbor in a new town during quarantine</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can explore <a href="/adventures">past adventures here</a>.</p>

        <h3>Office Hours</h3>
        <p>Each week, I set aside an hour for open office hours to chat with people new to the design industry.</p>
        <p>There’s a lot I’m working on improving about myself and my business. But, I’ve made a few things, worked with some people, started a few companies, and I’ve survived! There are so many people that have shared their experiences with me along the way, and it’s a privilege to be able to share my experiences with others.</p>
