		<p>I’m a graphic designer in New York City.</p>

		<p>I run <a href="http://www.havesomecottlestonpie.com">Cottleston Pie</a>, a tiny design studio. I’m the co-founder of <a href="https://www.keepastash.com">Stash</a>, a service to bring you joy through the mail. I ride my bike. A lot. Every week, I lend a hand with <a href="http://typedia.com/blog">Typedia Type News</a>. </p>

		<p>I’m very much enjoying New York City. I try to get to as many events around the city as I can. I do my best keep an open mind and learn a little something from everyone I meet. More often than not, I can be found biking around the city, <a href="http://instagram.com/davedawson">snapping photos</a>.</p>

  	<h2>Things I Make</h2>
  	<p>I get really excited about things. Sometimes the excitement even lasts long enough to become a real project! These are a few of the ones that made it:</p>

  	<h3><a href="http://www.onawednesday.com">On a Wednesday</a></h3>
		<p>On a Wednesday is a collaboration with <a href="http://www.bekkapalmer.com">Bekka Palmer</a> where we ask stangers what they're up to that day. The idea is to showcase the different types of lives people are leading all across this city.</p>

  	<h3><a href="http://www.keepastash.com">Stash</a></h3>
  	<p>Turn your mailbox back into a portal for fun. You choose the items you want. You tell us how much you want to spend. We send you gifts on an irregular basis, all year long. Isn't it time you treat yourself?</p>

  	<h3><a href="http://scrtchpd.com/">scrtchpd.com</a></h3>

  	<h3><a href="http://www.accesstogether.org">Access Together</a></h3>
  	<p>The goal of Access Together right now is to gather reliable accessibility data about venues. Users are able to search the database for locations that meet their specific accessibility requirements.</p>

		<h3><a href="http://www.onyourwayhere.com">On Your Way Here</a></h3>
		<p>On Your Way Here was an interview series that I started a few years back. It ran out of steam, but the idea was that each interview introduced me to the next, allowing the interviews to govern themselves.</p>
