		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>I'm a graphic designer living in Brooklyn. Hi! I'm passionate about design and the direction that the web is heading in and I'm curious about almost everything else.</p>

    <p>I make sure to surround myself with design and am constantly reading a new book on type or sitting down with a seasoned designer to <a href="http://www.onyourwayhere.com">hear their story</a>.</p>
    <p>Silly side projects (or not-so-silly ones) usually keep me busy outside of work. I appreciate that they afford me opportunities to learn something new in areas I wouldn't have explored otherwise.</p>
    <p>It's impossible to stop learning here in New York. People have been so kind and willing to share with me what someone shared with them when they were new to the city. I hope that I can do the same for someone else someday.</p>
    <p>I try to get to as many events around the city as I can, keep an open mind and learn something from everyone I meet.</p>
    <p>More often than not, I can be found riding around the city, snapping photos with my iphone.</p>
    <p>I'm actually pretty active on the web, despite how stale this site may end up getting. Scroll down a bit to get a taste.</p>
