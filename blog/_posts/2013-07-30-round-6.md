<p>This is the sixth edition of iamdavedawson.com.</p>

<p>That seems like a lot.</p>

<p>But hey, priorities change, so do websites. The goals for this redesign were pretty simple:</p>

<h3>Focus on projects</h3>
<p>Give more detail about project process and my role in teams. As a freelancer, the priority is to get my best work in front of people as soon as possible</p>

<h3>Less empty writing spaces</h3>
<p>The blog is no longer the focus of this site. Let’s be real, I haven’t been writing very much. So why have a bunch of empty space taking up most of a website?</p>
<p>I still plan on writing here, but just not all that frequently.</p>

<h3>Static, yo.</h3>
<p>Back to static content. The first and second editions of this site were static, and now it’s back. With a vengeance!</p>
<p>The past three versions of this site ran on <a href="http://ellislab.com/expressionengine">ExpressionEngine</a>, which is a great CMS. It was just overkill for what I need.</p>

<p>I built the site using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, which is a “blog aware static site generator.” Essentially, it does all the hard stuff for you, and generates static files that you can throw up on a server. Easy!</p>

<h3>Onward</h3>
<p>I’m hoping this site lasts me a while. I've got a couple new projects coming up and I'm excited to focus on them.</p>
