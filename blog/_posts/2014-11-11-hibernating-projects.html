<p>Can a web service be seasonal and remain relevant?</p>
<p>That’s what I’m going to find out. </p>

<p>I’ve been running <a href="http://www.getbiked.com">Get Biked</a> for just over a year now. It’s been great. 2014 had a beautiful biking season and Get Biked saw lots of bikes finding themselves good homes.</p>

<p>But things are cooling down, both in the city and on Get Biked. During the summer, there were between five and twelve new bikes listed each week. These days there’s usually between one and two bikes listed each week. <strong>So what happens now?</strong> I see a few options: </p>

<ul>
	<li>I could continue to send a weekly email with existing listings <em>(but risk annoying emails without much content)</em></li>
	<li>I could send an email only weeks when a bike is listed on the site <em>(but lose the regularity that Get Biked is known for)</em></li>
	<li>I could put Get Biked to sleep for a few months <em>(but be forgotten forever)</em></li>
</ul>

<p>I’ll be turning the Get Biked site off for a few months starting in mid-November. </p>

<h3>What does that mean? </h3>
<p>No new bikes will be added to the site and the weekly email will be put on hold. I plan on starting the service again in mid-April, 2015, when things start warming up in NYC. </p>

<h3>What will happen over the winter?</h3>
<p>This allows the Get Biked service to get a few updates over the winter, gives me time to think about where I’d like to take the service, and to relaunch in the spring which will hopefully bring more publicity than a continuous service would. </p>

<p>In a web where &#8220;out of sight, out of mind&#8221; is the name of the game, I do worry that bringing Get Biked back in the spring will be harder than it was to launch it. I’ll be sure to report back once the 2015 version of the site has launched to compare the initial launch against the re-launch. I’m curious to see the results.</p>

<h3>Got a bike to sell?</h3>
<p>The last Get Biked email of 2014 will go out on November 25. If you have a bike you've been meaning to sell, <a href="http://www.getbiked.com/list/">submit it this week</a>!</p>

<h3>I’m all ears</h3>
<p>Got any suggestions or features you’d like to see in the next version of Get Biked? <a href="mailto:dave@iamdavedawson.com">Send me an email</a> and let me know!</p>
