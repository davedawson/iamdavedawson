<article class="d3-d9 t2-t5">
<p>I take a lot of notes.</p>

<p>On phone calls, Google Hangouts, in-person conversations, I take notes. Sometimes I need to save those notes, sometimes I don't.</p>

<p>I wanted a tool that would enable me start taking notes quickly, without needing to open up a new application or website. So I created one and it's called <a href="http://scrtchpd.com">scrtchpd</a>.</p>

<p>I may have been the only person actually using the first version of scrtchpd. And after a year of thorough user testing, I've finally gotten around to making a few updates:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Redesigned the app, giving it a cleaner feel.</li>
    <li>Added support for Markdown</li>
    <li>Added a "Clear" button, allowing you to quickly get a fresh scrtchpd.</li>
</ul>

<h2>It's really simple.</h2>
<p>Just take notes. That's all you can do here!</p>

<p>scrtchpd used local storage to keep your notes for you when you come back to the site.</p>

<p>I use the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna">New Tab Redirect Chrome Extension</a> to open scrtchpd.com everytime I open a new tab in my browser. This gives me my scrtchpd very quickly.</p>

<p>Sometimes I save the notes to Google Docs or Editorially, sometimes they aren't needed and I can delete them. I'm planning on integrating some sort of "Save to Google Docs" integration eventually (if I can figure out how).</p>

<h2>Markdown</h2>
<p>The first version of scrtchpd was extremely simple, and I loved it for that. But my notes really lacked hierarchy. I've implemented support for Markdown, so when you're taking notes, you can seperate your ideas a little easier.</p>


<p>I'm just making this thing up as I go along, so let me know if you have any feedback or find it helpful.</p>
