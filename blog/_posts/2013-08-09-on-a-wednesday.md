  <p>A lot of people work during the day. A lot of people don't. </p>
  <p>What the hell are all of these people doing?</p>
  <p>I'm trying to find that out. Along with <a href="http://bekkapalmer.com/">Bekka Palmer</a>, I'm asking strangers about their Wednesdays, snapping a photo and putting it on a website. </p>
  <p>A project of pure curiosity, <a href="http://onawednesday.com/">On a Wednesday</a> has already gotten me up early on Wednesdays and exploring a few new neighborhoods in NYC. </p>
  <p>I'm really looking forward to growing this series over the next few months. Already, we're adapting the questions we ask and how they're being published. </p>
  <p>I'd love to hear any feedback if you have it. Anything you want to me to ask? </p>
