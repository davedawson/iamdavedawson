	<h3>I don’t claim to have all of the answers. There’s so much that I have left to learn. But, I’ve made a few things, worked with some people, started a few companies, and I’ve survived! It’s a privilege to be able to share those experiences with others.</h3>

	<div class="col1">
		<h3>What is the experience like?</h3>
		<p>We’ll have a 1/2 hour video conversation where we can talk about anything you want. I’ve listed a few suggested topics below based on things I have experience with, but the conversations are open and flexible to your needs.</p>

		<h3>What’s this going to cost me?</h3>
		<p>A good deed. And a quick form to fill out. The only request I have is that I reserve the right to take a question from our conversation (you’ll remain anonymous), and respond to it in an article. </p>
		<h3>Who you are</h3>
		<p>These conversations are completely open to anyone. But people who might get the most out of them might be: 
			<ul>
				<li>Young designers</li>
				<li>People considering a career change to working on the web</li>
				<li>Freelancers looking to grow their business</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h3>Who you are not</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Pitching a product or service</li>
				<li>A potential client</li>
