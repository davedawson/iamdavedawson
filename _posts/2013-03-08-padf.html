<p>The Pan American Development Foundation works Latin America and the Caribbean to create economic opportunities, promote social progress, strengthen communities and civil society, and respond to natural disasters. The design of a website isn't something they have time to worry about.</p>

<p>We were able to work with PADF to understand the work that they do and the audience that visits their website. It's an interesting situation in that the site isn't likely to be even seen by people who benefit from the work that PADF does. The site serves as more of an outlet where PADF can tell the world about the amazing work that they do.</p>

<p>We designed a portal that quickly explains the work that PADF does, the latest updates from the field and ways that one can get involved.</p>
