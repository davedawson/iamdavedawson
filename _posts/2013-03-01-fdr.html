description: 	I was so excited to design the website for the FDR Four Freedoms Park. It's a beautiful memorial to FDR designed by Louis Kahn with such an interesting history. I really wanted the website to reflect that.

<p>Such a fun project to work on. The FDR Four Freedoms Park sits at the bottom tip of Roose
velt Island, in the East River, between Manhattan and Queens. </p>

<p>The park is a memorial to FDR and his four freedoms. There's such a rich history to the park actually being built. I highly recommend visiting the park to fully experience it yourself.</p>

<p>The photography available is stunning. It really was a no-brainer to take as much advantage of it as possible. We open with a large background image and the logo overlaid on top. The idea was to really allow the photos to tell the story. My role as the designer was to get out of the way. With such a simply architected homepage, that wasn't too tough. We're offering up relevant information to visitors, but really allowing the park speak for itself.</p>
