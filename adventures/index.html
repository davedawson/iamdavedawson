            <h1>Always on some kind of adventure</h1>
            <p class="large">I love to experiment, to get lost in something out of my comfort zone, to create things and see how people react to them, to make something meaningful.</p>
            <p>This constant exploration has resulted in a lot of different types of adventures: online communties, in-person communities, digital products, a website that calls your phone, another Winnie the Pooh reference, and a long, long roadtrip.</p>
            <p>I’ve put together a list of some of my favorite adventures and what I learned about during the process of each. </p>
            <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> These are all personal projects, and not related to client work in any way.</p>

                        <h3>On a Wednesday</h3>
                        <p>A project of pure curiosity. For years, every Wednesday, <a href="http://www.bekkapalmer.com">Bekka Palmer</a> and I went out into New York City to ask people what they were up to. We recorded short responses and a photo. The product was a quick look into what everyday people are doing around town.</p>

                <h3>Get Biked</h3>
                <p>I get attached to my bikes, and whenever it's time to move to another bike I want to make sure that it goes to a good home. So I created an online community in NYC where people could find share their bikes for sale and ensure that it went to someone who would take care of it. </p>
