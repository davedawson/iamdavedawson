                <h3>On a Wednesday</h3>
                <p>A project of pure curiosity. For years, every Wednesday, <a href="http://www.bekkapalmer.com">Bekka Palmer</a> and I went out into New York City to ask people what they were up to. We recorded short responses and a photo. The product was a quick look into what everyday people are doing around town.</p>

                <h3>Get Biked</h3>
                <p>I get attached to my bikes, and whenever it's time to move to another bike I want to make sure that it goes to a good home. So I created an online community in NYC where people could find share their bikes for sale and ensure that it went to someone who would take care of it. </p>

                <p>I owned and operated a small, shared workspace in Brooklyn for two years. We had around a dozen desks in the space, made lots of new friends, held community events, and a few great parties.</p>
