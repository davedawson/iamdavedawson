<div class="d3-d9 t2-t5">
  <p>Surfrider Foundation approached Blue State Digital about a redesign in 2010.</p>
  <p>Working closely with <a href="http://www.wolasikonu.com/">Wolasi Konu</a>, we redesigned <a href="http://www.surfrider.org">surfrider.org</a> for action.</p>

	<p>In a fun and collaborative process with the client, we were able to land on a design that presents an appropriate first impression of the organization and their goals. Let's keep these beaches clean so we can get out there and enjoy them!</p>
