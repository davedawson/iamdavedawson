	<p>This project was in collaboration with <a href="http://jonnygotham.com/">Jonny Gotham</a> on both the design and build of this site. </p>
	<p>We worked with Dan to improve the overall look of the site, while focusing on allowing him to feature events happening at the shop. We also redesigned the booking system for reserving press time.</p>
