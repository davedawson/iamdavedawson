<div class="d3-d9 t2-t5">
  <p>June 1 was <a href="http://www.worldnotobaccodayafrica.org">World No Tobacco Day</a>. We put together a website showcasing the risks of tobacco use, specifically with children in Africa.</p>

  <p><a href="http://jukingthestats.com">Juking the Stats</a> &amp; Cottleston Pie collaborated on the project. I tackled the design and some responsive code and Juking the Stats took care of the back-end data and front-end structure.</p>

  <p>Africa has one of the fastest growing tobacco economies in the world. The goal of this campaign was to spread the information quickly and to get youth in Africa involved.</p>
