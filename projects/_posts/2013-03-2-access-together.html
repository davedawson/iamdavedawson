  <p><a href="http://www.accesstogether.org">Access Together</a> is the brainchild of <a href="http://www.base2john.com">John Schimmel</a>, a developer who focuses on accessible technology. We've been working together over the past year on a mobile web app in addition to a desktop site.</p>

  <p>The goal of Access Together right now is to gather reliable accessibility data about venues. Users are able to search the database for locations that meet their specific accessibility requirements.</p>

  <p>The app was recently added to Foursquare's app list, making it even easier to accessify your community when you check in to Foursquare. <a href="http://www.accesstogether.org/foursquare">Get on it!</a></p>
