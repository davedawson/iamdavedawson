  <p>The <a href="http://www.hrc.org/">Human Rights Campaign</a> is the largest civil rights organization dedicated to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender equality. Since 1980, HRC has been working for equal rights for LGBT Americans with the help of more than one million members and supporters and more than 10 million website visitors a year.</p>

  <p><em>Note: This article also appeared in the <a href="http://www.bluestatedigital.com/news/entry/youve-got-to-design-for-your-rights/">Blue State Digital</a> blog on September 26, 2011.</em></p>

  <p>In late 2010, Blue State Digital was tasked with redesigning hrc.org, the online home for the organization. With more than 16,000 individual pieces of content, an enormous number of micro-sites, energetic but sprawling local content, and five years since a redesign, the site was ready for an update.</p>

  <p>With an amazingly collaborative process, we were able to reorganize and consolidate the content down to just over 8,000 pages, redesign the look and feel, create templates and design standards for micro-sites, and set up a flexible publishing system, all with the goal of creating and maintaining a consistent online presence for HRC.</p>

  <p>How do you design a site for an organization with one of the most recognizable logos in the world? By not messing with a good thing. By taking visual cues from the already iconic identity and the HRC building in Washington D.C., we were able to design a homepage that at first glance, gives a concise first impression of what HRC is working towards, both as an organization and a campaign. If you look closely, the geometry of the homepage grid is inspired by the logo itself.</p>

  <p>The homepage pulls in content from key areas of the site, showing off the different issues that HRC works on. We included a full-width feature section to have an emotional impact with the use of large, striking imagery. The news section shows the dynamic work of HRC with up to the moment updates.</p>

  <p>To navigate all of this and the rest of the site, we created a visual system and hierarchy that allows users to easily explore the site. With more than 8,000 pieces of content, itâ€™s important to be clear where the user currently is and guide them through to other, related content.</p>

  <p>As exciting as it is to see this site go live, I think we are all much more excited to see the site being used to organize and engage people.</p>
