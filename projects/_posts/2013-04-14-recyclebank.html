<div class="d3-d9 t2-t5">
  <p>In an effort to boost the number of sign ups on Recyclebank, we took a stab at redesigning the homepage.</p>

  <p>Our goal was to allow users to get into the site as quickly as possible and signed up for the service.</p>

  <p>One of the issues with the original homepage was trying to explain the concept clearly. Because it's such a complex issue and solution, we felt it was best to walk the user through the process, encintivizing them along the way.</p>

  <p>Now when you visit recyclebank.com, you are instantly engaging in the earning of points.</p>
