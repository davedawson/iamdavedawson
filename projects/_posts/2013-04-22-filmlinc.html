description:    A year after our redesign of the Film Society Lincoln Center site, we're back again.

<div class="d3-d9 t2-t5">
  <p>We worked very closely with the team at <a href="http://www.filmlinc.com">Film Linc</a> to redesign their homepage. I was a part of the original homepage design team, led my <a href="http://www.bluestatedigital.com/staff/matt-ipcar">Matt ipcar</a>. But after a few years, the priorities and needs of the organization  changed and it was time to update the site accordingly.</p>

  <p>They have beautiful stills from the films they feature, we wanted to highlight those more, so we expanded the hero area and overlayed the description text on the image. </p>

  <p>Ad revenue has also become more of a factor for the organization. We made that a priority in this redesign. Allowing the published content to continue to get the priority that it deserves, while still meeting the business goals of the site.</p>
