  <p>Turn your mailbox back into a portal for fun.</p>
	<p>Stash is a service that is currently in private beta. The idea is that you create a list of items that you would like to gift to yourself, set aside a budget in your Stash, and then we send the gifts to you throughout the year. Providing a fun surprise in the mail, with something you actually want.</p>
	<p>We're working on v2 of the service and are hoping to open it up to the public later this year.</p>
