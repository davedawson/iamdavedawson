<div class="d3-d9 t2-t5">
  <p>The <a href="http://newdirectors.org">New Directors New Films Festival</a> is an annual event in NYC. This past year I designed the website along with <a href="http://jaredlaser.com">Jared Laser</a> who did much of the front-end code. Working closely with the team at <a href="http://www.filmlinc.com">FilmLinc</a>, we highlighted a few films and really brought out the amazing imagery available to them.</p>

  <p>With such beautiful stills from the films, how could we not highlight them at huge sizes? </p>

  <p>Working closely with Jared laser, we created a system of quick access to film trailers and the schedule right from the homepage. </p>

  <p>One of my favorite parts of the site was the splash page, before they announced the films. We had the stills, but they hadn't been announced yet. So we placed the logo on top of the blurred still. And then when they finally announced e films, we added a button that would unblur the still behind the logo, revealing the film title and image.</p>
