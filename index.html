                <h3>Looking for a team to tackle a problem?</h3>
                <p class="">If your organization needs a team to create a digital product or website, or if you just don’t know where to start, <a href="http://www.havesomecottlestonpie.com">Cottleston Pie</a> is where I assemble small and mighty teams to solve those types of problems. <a href="http://www.havesomecottlestonpie.com">Get in touch</a>.</p>
                <h3>Looking for someone to augment your own team?</h3>
                <p class="">As a studio owner, I wear many hats and have years of experience in client services, but when I’m not leading projects myself, <strong>my primary role is product and website design, creative direction, and consulting</strong>. If you’re looking for someone to augment your existing team or lead a project, then you’re in the right place. Below is an overview of the type of work I do.</p>

                    <h4>What I do</h4>
                    <h2>Product Design</h2>
                    <p>My favorite product teams are the small and scrappy ones. I value moving quickly, prototyping, testing, and iterating. But, the most important part of product design is understanding and defining the problem we're solving. The earlier we do that, and validate our assumptions with users, the smoother the entire process will be.</p>
                    <p>Pixel perfect designs are a good goal to have, but they're not something that should get in the way of a proof of concept. I believe in getting something out quickly, testing it with real users, and iterating our way to pixel perfection. I’m a designer who codes, so I'm able to jump in with your team to prototype ideas, and even style base components to get to launch quickly.</p>

We created a dashboard where supporters could access the most important actions that could take and get the latest content. By the end of the campaign we had sent out over a million notecards that supporters filled out and mailed to voters.

                    <h2>Website Design</h2>
                    <p>Designing a website is designing for message and action. And of course, aligning stakeholders, defining content requirements and processes, outlining a website’s architecture, visualizing a brand’s identity in a digital medium, and making sure it looks great and performs well on all devices. </p>
                    <p>I’ve designed scores of websites over the past 15 years. Many of those have been cause-based, but I’ve also worked in the arts and editorial spaces. I believe that design is a tool to serve a website’s content and should be only as visible as it needs to be. I design websites that support the message and the priorities of your organization.</p>

                                <strong>Need to Impeach</strong>
                                As the creative director on the campaign to impeach Donald Trump, I led the Design and Video teams to create digital content for our supporters and a large digital advertising program for our targeted members of Congress. The credit goes to our supporters and members of Congress who stood up for justice, but I’m pretty happy to have “helped to impeach Donald Trump” on my list of career accomplishments.

                                I've consulted with organizations of all sizes to help leadership get a better understanding of their digital strategy and how to best use the resources they have to accomplish their organizational goals.
